# evm-asset-bridge

BitSafeEvmAssetBridge: an upgradeable EVM contract that locks one asset
(ETH or one ERC20) and releases it on attestor-signed withdrawal. BETH
(bridged ETH on Canton) is the first deployment.

- Build: `forge build`
- Test: `forge test`
- The design spec is maintained locally, outside git (not tracked in this repo).

## Production deploy

`script/Deploy.s.sol` deploys the implementation behind a
`TransparentUpgradeableProxy` and writes
`deployments/BitSafeEvmAssetBridge.<chainId>.json`. It reads its
configuration entirely from environment variables:

| Env var | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ASSET` | Bridged asset address; `address(0)` for ETH, else the ERC20 address |
| `TARGET_DECIMALS` | Decimal places the target chain expresses; `10` for Canton, 18 maximum |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN` | Address granted the default admin role (governs role management) |
| `ADMIN_DELAY` | Default-admin transfer delay, in seconds |
| `BRIDGE_ADMIN` | Address granted `BRIDGE_ADMIN_ROLE` (pause, limits, rescue) |
| `PROXY_OWNER` | Owner of the `ProxyAdmin` created for the transparent proxy |
| `ATTESTORS` | Comma-separated attestor addresses granted `ATTESTOR_ROLE` |
| `THRESHOLD` | Number of attestor signatures required per withdrawal |
| `DEPOSIT_MIN` | Minimum deposit amount (0 = no minimum) |
| `DEPOSIT_MAX` | Maximum deposit amount (`type(uint256).max` = no maximum) |
| `WITHDRAW_MIN` | Minimum withdrawal amount (0 = no minimum) |
| `WITHDRAW_MAX` | Maximum withdrawal amount (`type(uint256).max` = no maximum) |

The output JSON also records `assetDecimals`, `targetDecimals`, and
`depositUnit`, so an operator can read the live granularity rule from the
deployment record.

`GIT_COMMIT` (optional) is recorded in the output JSON alongside the
compiler version for provenance; it defaults to `"unknown"` when unset.

Run with:

```
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --broadcast
```

## Deposit granularity

Canton expresses 10 decimal places. ETH has 18. A deposit of 1 wei therefore has
no Canton representation, and the bridge would lock ETH that it can never mint.
The contract blocks this at the source.

`initialize` takes `targetDecimals` and reads the asset's own decimals. For ETH
it uses 18, because ETH has no contract to ask. For an ERC20 it calls
`decimals()`. That function is OPTIONAL in EIP-20, so a token without it cannot
be bridged; `initialize` reverts.

From the two values the contract derives the deposit unit:

```
depositUnit = 10 ** (assetDecimals - targetDecimals)
```

Every deposit amount must be a whole multiple of that unit. A deposit that is
not reverts with `AmountNotRepresentable(amount, depositUnit)`. For ETH and
Canton the unit is `1e8` wei. A frontend reads `depositUnit()` and rounds the
amount down before it sends the transaction.

Three rules follow from the formula:

- The unit is `1` when `targetDecimals` is at or above `assetDecimals`. Every
  amount is then representable, and the check accepts everything.
- `initialize` reverts with `DecimalsOutOfRange` when the asset or the target
  reports more than 18 decimals. The value 18 is the idiomatic maximum
  precision, so a larger value is a misconfiguration. A larger `targetDecimals`
  clamps the unit to 1, which accepts every amount. A typo then disables the
  check without a warning.
- `setDepositLimits` rejects a band that holds no multiple of the unit. Such a
  band would block every deposit and warn nobody.

The withdraw path carries no granularity check. Canton cannot burn an amount it
cannot express, so the release amount is always representable by construction.

## Attestor signing (Rust)

Attestors authorize a withdrawal by signing an EIP-712 typed-data digest.
The contract verifies the digest with `_hashTypedDataV4`; the Rust attestor
stack produces the identical digest with [Alloy](https://docs.rs/alloy-sol-types).

The signed struct and its type string (field names are part of the digest —
they must match byte for byte):

```
Withdrawal(bytes withdrawRequestId,address destinationAddress,uint256 amount)
```

The domain has four fields. `verifyingContract` is the bridge PROXY address
of the target deployment, never the implementation address:

| Domain field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | `BitSafeEvmAssetBridge` |
| `version` | `1` |
| `chainId` | The target chain id (read live by the contract) |
| `verifyingContract` | The bridge proxy address |

Complete Rust flow:

```rust
use alloy_primitives::{Address, Bytes, B256, U256};
use alloy_signer::SignerSync;
use alloy_signer_local::PrivateKeySigner;
use alloy_sol_types::{eip712_domain, sol, SolStruct};

sol! {
    struct Withdrawal {
        bytes withdrawRequestId;
        address destinationAddress;
        uint256 amount;
    }
}

fn sign_withdrawal(
    signer: &PrivateKeySigner,
    bridge_proxy: Address,
    chain_id: u64,
    cid_bytes: Vec<u8>,        // the raw Canton WithdrawRequest cid bytes
    destination: Address,
    amount_wei: U256,
) -> eyre::Result<Vec<u8>> {
    let domain = eip712_domain! {
        name: "BitSafeEvmAssetBridge",
        version: "1",
        chain_id: chain_id,
        verifying_contract: bridge_proxy,
    };

    let message = Withdrawal {
        withdrawRequestId: Bytes::from(cid_bytes),
        destinationAddress: destination,
        amount: amount_wei,
    };

    let digest: B256 = message.eip712_signing_hash(&domain);
    let signature = signer.sign_hash_sync(&digest)?;

    // 65 bytes: r (32) || s (32) || v (1), v in {27, 28}, low-s form.
    Ok(signature.as_bytes().to_vec())
}
```

Rules the contract enforces on submission (`withdraw`):

- Signatures may arrive in ANY order; no sorting by signer address.
- Each signer may appear once; a duplicate reverts.
- Every submitted signature must recover to a current `ATTESTOR_ROLE` holder.
- At least `threshold` signatures are required; the caller must hold
  `ATTESTOR_ROLE`.
- Each `withdrawRequestId` executes once, forever.

Before rollout, cross-check the encoding against the live contract: the view
`withdrawalDigest(withdrawRequestId, destinationAddress, amount)` returns the
exact digest the contract verifies. Assert your locally computed digest equals
it. Note for raw-key or KMS setups: sign the digest bytes directly (no
`personal_sign` / Ethereum Signed Message prefix — the EIP-712 `\x19\x01`
envelope is already inside the digest).
